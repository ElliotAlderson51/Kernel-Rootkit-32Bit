# Rootkit-32Bit
## Introduction
Hey, after I read the books:    
  "Windows Kernel Programming" by Pavel Yosifovich     
  "The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System 2nd Edition"
 
I decide to create a Kernel Rootkit for 32-bit system.

Now I'll start learning how to create a Kernel Rootkit for 64-bit!

Enjoy.

## What the Rootkit can do?

### Hook the SSDT
